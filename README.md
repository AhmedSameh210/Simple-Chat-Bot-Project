# Simple-Chat-Bot-Project
simple chat bot made using deep learning and NLP by make a preprocessing by NLP then make a neural network that take the input and predict the probability of each tag then easly the chat bot choose random response based on the tag 

the input of the model is the pattern after convert it to the bag of words .
to improve the quality of this chat bot we can increase the tags and the patterns in the json file but it is demo of simple chat bot right now 


future work :
* change the approach of using json file and replace it with api of already trained chat bot to be highly performance
* make a gui to be user friendly
